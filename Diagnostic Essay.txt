We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.

    The above text comes from the famous 'I have a Dream Speech' by MLK Jr. In this excerpt, he explains why they have marched to Washington DC, and explains that reform via gradual policy is not enough. 
     'We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now'. In the opening sentence, MLK wastes no time opening with a strong statement clearly emphasizing that now is the time for action. While this line works quite well within the context of the speech given the subject matter, it also works in the context of an introduction serving as a message that now is the time to pay attention.  MLK ends this opening sentence with the word 'Now', and in doing so he sets the stage for the rest of the paragraph in that many sentences in the paragraph begin with the word Now. 
     In the next sentence, MLK then uses the interesting phrase 'engage in the luxury of cooling off' in reference to the protests that had happened recently in the name of the Civil Rights Movement.  After such protests, the people were left with two choices, to either absorb what had happened and proceed slowly from there, or to build on that action with more action. Of course, it is harder to engage in this action because it requires time, commitment, and energy, and this is why MLK calls passivity a luxury. The very phrase 'cooling off' … The point is reinforced with the analogy 'take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism'. Again MLK is saying that people would rather take things gradually, and by portraying it as a drug, he is asserting that the more people decide to follow the path of least resistance, the more likely people are to continue following it. 
     'the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.' Above, MLK compares segregation to a dark and desolate valley. The imagery above allows us to glean his (obvious) opinion of segregation being backwards and a low point. The concept of a low point can be seen in his use of the word valley , since geographically speaking a valley is considered to be a low point. MLK then contrasts this with a 'sunlit path of racial justice'. The phrase sunlit path does two things. The first that it obviously implies that the path is associated with light, as opposed to the darkness that segregation was associated with. In addition, since the Sun is often associated with a higher power or higher being, MLK is implying that racial justice is the divine way to go, which makes sense considering the other references to God not only in this paragraph, but also throughout the speech. 
     MLK then uses the phrase 'lift our nation from the quicksands of brotherhood to the solid rock of brotherhood'. The use of the phrase 'quicksands' implies that due to segregation, our nation is in a state of decay, and if the problem is not solved our nation would be ruined. MLK again employs contrast to compare segregation which is portrayed as  unstable and dangerous to a 'solid rock of brotherhood', in order to show how racial unity would provide a stable base for the country going forward.
    Throughout the paragraph, the word Now is used multiple times at the beginning of three sentences in order to emphasize the underlying message that action has to be taken immediately, rather than something which can be put off to whenever convenient, and inspires the reader or listener that they are capable of doing something good for the world.
